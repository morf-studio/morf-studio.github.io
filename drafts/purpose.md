# Purpose

We're setting out to build the creative studio we wish existed.

(Say what we DO, not what we want to do? "We build brands for Visionaries" // "We ____ for ____")

Studio vs. Agency
There is a strong differentiation to the fact we say 'Studio' instead of 'Agency'
A studio is approachable.
An Agency has process and tradition.
A studio decides to oil paint on wednesday afternoon in the office.
An Agency has strictly kept work hours.


## Principles of Practice:

1. Design Theory
- The best design starts early, digs deep, and doesn't stop as time goes on. (...)
- There are problems everywhere that need solving. You hire a designer to do the struggling for you. We take joy in the hunt for elegant solutions. And Alex has really great hair.

2. Polishing Turds //feels similar to 3. -- Is it important to say this at all?
- No one likes polishing a turd. For that reason, we are not looking to sell products that we don't believe in
- We will not sell empty promises. If theres a product or idea we don't believe in, we won't accept the job. If we think the idea is great but the business isn't quite there, we want to be involved in the strategy of making the product better before we try to convince people to like it.

3. Partnerships
- We want to feel as confident in our clients as they do in us. For that reason, we will be careful to make sure we feel our goals and stories align. We do our best work when we are in the company of the right people who have the right chemistry. And that doesn't mean the same opinion or perspective in the world. But the hot air must always propel us in an upward spiral.

("We make considered, relevant and long-lasting brands for visionaries of all varieties" -omfgco)

** SHOW DONT TELL
I don't want to say we do all this shit. I want to say it in an interesting way.
Like some kind of short story, or a simple example/parable.

### For Ourselves

### For Our Clients

- Function and Form
both need to be successful in order to capture attention, great food without a sign means slow growth, but beautiful menus with disappointing food will kill a customer base. We understand that you need both to succeed.
Our creative goals are always directly aligned with business goals.
No one wants to polish a turd.
We'll say it plain and simple. We're not in the business of polishing turds.
We work

- Everything All The Time
Nothing builds business strength like brand consistency in every touchpoint.

For Our Employees / Other Coworkers

- We believe that autonomy and community are the most important factors in a creative career.
Without control of your work and trust from your teammates, you become a cog, and you lose heart and reason for working. Nothing kills our creativity like hierarchy, micromanagement, and 8 hours at the same desk.

So how do function as a company??
We have regular check-ins at fixed times & places, but keep minimal office hours so no one burns out.


- Critique & Iteration
There are a lot of words for this process, but we think that the creative classroom model is among the most effective ways for moving projects forward. The desire to keep up with your peers and impress ones mentors is a powerful motivator in self initiated work.

We're glad you made it this far.
