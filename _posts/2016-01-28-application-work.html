  <h1>The Grid</h1>
  <h6 class="">UX, UI, Icons, Front-end Dev, Marketing Design</h6>
  <div class="measure pad-y-m">
    <p>The Grid is an AI website builder platform. Think Squarespace but with robots making smart design decisions based on your content instead of you choosing fonts and colors at random.</p>
    <p>When we were hired, the product had advanced engineering components but lacked a cohesive user experience. Our job was to design an interface that would make this powerful technology understandable and easy to use.</p>
    <p>To our knowledge, no one had ever built an interface for a tool like this before. We were dreaming big, and needed a way to quickly test ideas and avoid dead ends. To do this, we employed a process of rapid prototyping, user-testing, and iteration with our engineering team. Eventually arriving at a beta UI as unique as the tool itself.</p>

  <p>Sample #2</p>
  <h1>Bright Pink - Assess Your Risk </h1>
  <h6>UX, UI, Front-End Development, Prototyping </h6>
  <div class="measure pad-y-m">
    <p>Bright Pink is the only national non-profit organization focused on prevention and early detection of breast and ovarian cancer in young women. As part of a strategic re-brand, they wanted to rethink their self-assessment tool for Breast and Ovarian cancer.
    </p>
    <p>We were contracted to design and prototype early stage concepts, ultimately building the framework for the Webby Award winning app.

  <p>Sample #3</p>
  <h1>Energy Realities</h1>
  <h6>UX, UI</h6>
  <div class="measure pad-y-m">
    <p>National Geographic needed an iPad focused web application to visualize global energy consumption, production, and distribution across multiple sectors and years, giving users a clear picture of the past and a snapshot of the future.
    </p>
    <p>They came to us with extensive research data in spreadsheets, but no preconceived plan for how to organize the information or make a compelling experience for digesting such important facts.
    </p>
    <p>We sketched, prototyped, and designed the final UI for the data exploration, giving users a method to explore changes in production and consumption over time, drill down into geographic locations, see layered comparisons between energy types, and measure between regions.</p>
