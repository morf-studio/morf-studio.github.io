    <!-- <h3>The Grid</h3> -->
    <p>The Grid is an AI website builder platform. Think Squarespace but with robots making smart design decisions based on your content instead of you choosing fonts and colors at random.</p>
    <p>When we were hired, the product had advanced engineering components but lacked a cohesive user experience. Our job was to design an interface that would make this powerful technology understandable and easy to use.</p>
    <p>To our knowledge, no one had ever built an interface for a tool like this before. We were dreaming big, and needed a way to quickly test ideas and avoid dead ends. To do this, we employed a process of rapid prototyping, user-testing, and iteration with our engineering team. Eventually arriving at a beta UI as unique as the tool itself.</p>
